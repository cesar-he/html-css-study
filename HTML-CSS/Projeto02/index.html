                    <p class="dagon">Dagon is a deity from Mesopotamian mythology who was incorporated into H. P. Lovecraft's fiction in the short story "Dagon", eventually becoming a prominent element of the Cthulhu Mythos, where he is often referred to as Father Dagon. In the stories of Lovecraft and others, he presides over the Deep Ones, a hidden amphibious humanoid race that resides in the Earth's oceans, and is worshipped by the Esoteric Order of Dagon, a secret cult based in Innsmouth. He is the consort of Mother Hydra.</p>

                    <p class="dagon">In the real world, Dagon or Dagan was a deity worshipped in Mesopotamia, particularly in what is now Syria. He may have been connected with fertility or grain. He appears in the Hebrew Bible as a leading god of the Philistines, notably in Judges 16, where Samson brings down the temple of Dagon where he is being held captive. The similarity of Dagon to the Hebrew word dag ("fish") led to a depiction of the deity as half man, half fish, like a merman, and to a misconception in Western culture of Dagon as a kind of sea god.</p>
